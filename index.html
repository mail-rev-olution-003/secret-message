        <p id="message" style="display:none;">
            It has been wonderful spending these months with you at Alliance Francaise.
            Though you won't be joining us for the next session, I wanted to give you these bracelets
            to remind you that you have a brother who will always support your success.

            Buttercup, a flower symbolizing happiness and warmth, embodies your spirit.
            You have incredible potential to impact the world positively.
            I've noticed your problem-solving skills, creativity, and your passion for helping others.
            Remember, though, to explore and embrace your true self without letting fear or shyness hold you back.

            You radiate boldness and light; let that shine brightly!
            I pray that God guides you toward your true purpose.
            Know that I’m here whenever you need to talk, share ideas, or seek solutions.
            Don’t hesitate to reach out.

            And let’s not forget, one day we'll have that car race! Wishing you all the best.
            May God continue to bless you abundantly.
        </p>
